# Getting started with Rust

## Installation

- When starting out with rust, we must start from the obvious point, installation.
- To install Rust compiler from the command line, run the following command:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

- After this is done, we will run this command:

```sh
. $HOME/.cargo/env
```

- By this point we should have rust compiler successfully installed in our machine, we can confirm
this by running the command below to check the version installed:

```sh
rustc --version
```
